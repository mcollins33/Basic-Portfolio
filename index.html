		<p>Hi!  My name is Miki Collins.  I recently relocated to Peachtree City, GA.  I have been a Georgia resident my entire life.  I was born and raised in Lakeland, GA and have also lived in Savannah.  I have been married for 15 years and am the mother of two amazing kids.  I am a Mechanical Engineer by trade, graduating from Georgia Tech with a BME in 1999; however, my interests lie in arts and crafts.  In my spare time I enjoy painting, scrapbooking, photography, crochet, and helping my kids with their projects.  I also have a sense of adventure and love to travel. In recent years, I have been on multiple trips cruising the Carribean and enjoying learning about the heritage and culture in these areas.  One of my most memorable trips was to Ocho Rios where I jumped off a 30' cliff.</p>  

		<p>Having worked for the past 20 years in a manufacturing environment in engineering and management roles, I am excited to begin a new venture utilizing my artistic talents in coding and web development. </p>
